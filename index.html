        <h2>More than just a music festival</h2>
        <p>The intersection of live entertainment and social justice movements has been around for as long as popular music has existed, from Bob Dylan readily crooning his anti-Vietnam war sentiments to N.W.A being arrested at a Detroit concert for performing
            “Fuck tha Police” toBikini Kill protesting through song and dance at the Pro-Choice Rally at the National Mall. Over the last couple of decades, however, opportunities and spaces for new artists to collaborate with social justice movements
            have dwindled, and there have be en even fewer spaces that invite fans to join these collaborations. Emerge, a Las Vegas-based festival that showcases musicians, artists, and current thought leaders, seeks to re-establish this crucial collaboration
            in their second year. “What we wanted to do was bring that collaboration back at a time when it seems like there isn’t a soundtrack to the current protest movements that are going on right now,” says Rehan Choudhry, founder of the Emerge festival.
            Part of the reason for this lack of a “soundtrack” is a result of how much music listening and music discovery have changed over the past 15 years, giving young fans a surplus amount of artists to listen to and agree with. For developing artists,
            choosing a perspective on any given topic within our overwhelming 24-hour news cycle risks a volatile social media comment firestorm. “There’s a lot of talent out there that are nervous about aligning themselves with a specific cause, especially
            young in their careers, so we wanted to create a forum where they could do that,” explains Choudhry.

        <h2>LIfe tastes better with coffee</h2>
        <p>
            Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. All fruit must be further processed from a raw material—the fruit and seed—into a stable, raw product; un-roasted, green coffee. ... It is usually
            served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Millions of people around the world enjoy a cup of coffee, whether at home, whilst on the move or at work. Coffee is one of the most researched ingredients; resulting in the publication
            of hundreds of scientific studies every year. In 2003, the Institute for Scientific Information on Coffee (ISIC) identified a strategic need to become more proactive in informing medical and healthcare professionals and specialist medical
            media about current scientific knowledge and understanding on coffee consumption and health. esearch among health care professionals across Europe identified a widely spread lack of current knowledge about the health effects of coffee and
            many misconceptions among doctors, nurses, dieticians and other healthcare professionals who, in turn, provide advice to patients and clients about the effects of drinking coffee on health. ISIC has embarked on a pan-European education programme,
            working in partnership with national coffee associations in 9 countries including: Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Russia, Spain and UK.

        <h2>American dream</h2>
        <p>
            How to Measure the American Dream Today, homeownership is frequently cited as an example of attaining the American dream. It is a symbol of financial success and independence, and it means the ability to control one’s own dwelling place instead of being
            subject to the whims of a landlord. Owning a business and being one’s own boss also represents the American dream fulfillment. In addition, access to education and healthcare have been cited as elements of the Dream. Homeownership has steadily
            increased over time in the U.S., reflecting a key aspect of owning your own property as a sign of achieving the American Dream. For example, the homeownership rate at the end of 2020 was 65.8%, reflecting an increase of 0.7% higher than the
            previous year.5 Entrepreneurship has always been important to the U.S. economy too. In 2019, small businesses created 1.6 million net jobs alone.6 Owning property, one's own business, and carving a life of one's own making is all part of the
            American dream, and the U.S. as a first-world country also offers the benefits of pursuing these passions, without having to worry about basics such as accessing good education and healthcare.
